# Rust 2D Engine

A minimalist 2D graphics engine written in Rust, leveraging SDL2 for rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Rust** (install via `rustup`)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)
- **SDL2** (installed via Homebrew on macOS)

To install SDL2 on macOS:
```bash
brew install sdl2
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LMouhssine/rust_2d_engine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd rust_2d_engine
   ```

3. Build the project to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

To run the engine and see the graphics rendering:
```bash
cargo run
```

A window will open displaying the 2D engine's rendering.
